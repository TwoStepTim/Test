            <p>For almost 100 years, Scouting programs have instilled in youth the values found in the Scout Oath and Scout Law. Today, these values are just as relevant in helping youth grow to their full potential as they were in 1910. Scouting helps youth develop academic skills, self-confidence, ethics, leadership skills, and citizenship skills that influence their adult lives.</p>

            <ol class="Reasons">
            <li>Try new things.</li>
            <li>Provide service to others.</li>
            <li>Build self-confidence.</li>
            <li>Reinforce Ethical Standards.</li>

            <ol class="Notes">
                <li>While various activities and youth groups teach basic skills and promote teamwork, Scouting goes beyond that and encourages youth to achieve a deeper appreciation for service to others in their community.<li>
                <li>Scouting provides youth with a sense that they are important as individuals. It is communicated to them that those in the Scouting family care about what happens to them, regardless of whether a game is won or lost.</li>
                <li>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Scouting promotes activities that lead to personal responsibility and high self-esteem. As a result, when hard decisions have to be made, peer pressure can be resisted and the right choices can be made.</li>

                <h3>Troop 253 Program</h3>
                <p class="topP">
                    To be eligible, a boy must be between the ages of 10(6th grade) to 18 . If a boy is younger than 10 we invite them to join our cub scouting program. 
                    Weekly troop meetings are designed to prepare and plan for the monthly big event.  The greatest outdoor experience on the calendar is the week of Boy 
                    Scout Summer Camp.  In one week of summer camp, a scout may learn and earn as much as in 6 months of monthly outings.</p>
                <p>The troop is organized in patrols of between 4 to 7 scouts that are similar in age and experience.  The patrol chooses a leader from amongst itself and 
                    an adult advisor is assigned to each patrol.  The troop is lead by a Sr. Patrol Leader who is elected by the entire troop.  The Sr. Patrol Leader is 
                    advised by the Scoutmaster.</p>

                <h3>WHAT WE EXPECT</h3>
                <p class="topP">
                    Scouts are expected to live by the ideals of the Scout Oath, Scout Law, Scout motto, Scout Slogan, and Outdoor Code.  We wear uniforms to every meeting
                     and outing.  Our principle fundraisers are popcorn sales and Christmas Luminary sales.  Our popcorn selling tradition is well noted as our troop 
                     treasure was once featured on the Trails End Popcorn National Campaign brochure and one of our scouts has topped the district in sales for many years.</p>
                <p>With our strong fundraising, support from our sponsoring organization and experienced, leadership, we are committed to providing our scouts a program 
                    that fulfills the promise of scouting.   Our youth make lifelong friends as they develop Citizenship, character, and fitness. We honor and thank God 
                    for this opportunity to serve youth. </p>
